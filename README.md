# Techstars Engineering: Fun Front to Back

Submission to the Techstars Engineering Full Stack code Challenge, for creating and deploying a basic Company Directory web application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

- Node 12

## Installation/Development
- Run the development server using `yarn dev` and access the website at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Testing
- Run the tests with `yarn test`

## Deployment
- Build the production deployment with `yarn build`
- Deploy on Vercel (modified verbage from generated)
  - The "easiest" way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
